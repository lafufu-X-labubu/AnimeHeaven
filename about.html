        This company was made ages ago in 1967, me and my friend discovered tons
        of oil and gas near our house. We bought some machines for that, after
        all of our hard work we got some oil and gas we sold it and got some
        money. We made a company named as you all know Gold Corparation, this
        was greatest decision in my life. We made tons of money our company
        became popular in seconds. Well at start we had problems with some
        people, but we dealt with them very soon. Now our company is doing many
        things for example getting gold and other minerals. In this year we
        earned about 100 000 000$. My team has 100 members, all of them are
        proffesionals at their work. Currect general director is Paul Dejek.
